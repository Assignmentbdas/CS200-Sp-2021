Requirements:
Make sure you have python installed.
On Linux or Mac, open a terminal and type "python" and
check if you get a python shell prompt. (Ctrl-D to exit)
On Windows, type cmd to open terminal and then try "python"
or python.exe

Usage:
First, make sure you have python in your shell path. It should already be on Linux and Mac.
On Windows, please follow instructions at https://realpython.com/installing-python/ to see if
you already have it installed and how to install it.

If you are not able to install python for some reason, use the alternative option described below.

1. Go to github.com/whitebrandy/CS200-SP-2021 and click the "Fork" button at the right side of the screen.

2. Once you have a forked copy, clone it into your local system
   git clone git@github.com:<yourusername>/CS200-SP-2021
   where yourusername is your github username

3. cd into the newly cloned repo and create a new branch:
   cd CS200-SP-2021
   git checkout HEAD -b assignment

4. Add the repo referenced above as "upstream"
   git remote add upstream git@github.com:whitebrandy/CS200-SP-2021

5. Make sure you have python installed and execute:
   python ./create.file.py "Your Name, no spaces please"

   This should create a file called "Yourname".txt with the current date and time in it.

   ___________________
   Alternative option:
   -------------------
   If you can't use the script for some reason, please create a file with your first name; eg:
   john.txt and enter the current date and time and save it.
   
6. Commit the changes to your local repo. Make sure you enter a meaningful commit message
   and in the description for the commit, write down the steps you will execute for this
   assignment.
   Also, please make sure to add a signed-off-by line.
   
   git add filename
   git commit -s

8. Go to your project page on github.com and create a pull request (PR)
   See https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request
   and refer to the class to check how to create a pull request.

9. Once I have accepted your pull request, go back to your local copy
   and switch branch to main.
   git checkout main

10. Pull new changes that have been merged in my repo to your main branch.
    Please not that you have to give it some time in case there are changes
    that I have to merge manually.

    git pull upstream main

11. Identify your commit from the recently pulled changes and then
    send the "commit ID" for the "MERGE REQUEST". You can use "git log" for this: For eg:
